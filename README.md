Last plugin deployment jar: https://github.com/setial/intellij-javadocs/raw/master/ideajavadocs.zip

## this is my fork of the plugin ##
* introduce a new template variable $fieldName for getters and setters.
* make the settings global and exportable.

BTW, the useless javadoc comments is really boring and useless (as it's name suggests), but sometimes, you are forced(fucked) to write them, use this plugin to make your life easier.

enjoy it.
